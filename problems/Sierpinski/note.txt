The output can be computed row-by-row by starting with a single filled cell
at the left of the first row and setting each cell in a row to the XOR of the
cell above it and the cell to the above-left of it. The first cell in a row
is always filled. Following this pattern will generate Sierpinski's triangle.

This type of computation is known as a cellular automaton. The automaton which
generates the Sierpinski's triangle is known as Rule 90.
